== Add GitHub to Prisma Cloud Code Security

Integrating Github.com allows Prisma Cloud to:

* Include your Infrastructure-as-Code files in daily scans.
* Scan changed resources in Infrastructure-as-Code files for every new build generated, (before the branch is merged into the main branch) and provide an actionable view of the results via GitHub checks. For more details see //TODO: [Get Familiar with Reviewing Scan Results].
* Open Pull Requests to Fix build-time issues detected in your branch. //TODO: For more details see [Manual Fix for Commit].
