== Add GitHub to Prisma Cloud Code Security

Integrating Github.com allows Prisma Cloud to:

* Include your Infrastructure-as-Code files in daily scans.
* Scan changed resources in Infrastructure-as-Code files for every new build generated, (before the branch is merged into the main branch) and provide an actionable view of the results via GitHub checks.
//TODO: For more details see [Get Familiar with Reviewing Scan Results].
* Open Pull Requests to Fix build-time issues detected in your branch.
//TODO: For more details see [Manual Fix for Commit].
