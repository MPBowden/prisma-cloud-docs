== Connect Your Repositories to Code Security

The DevSecOps capabilities support a wide range of Cloud DevSecOps, Integrated Development Environments ( IDEs), and CI/CD pipelines that you use to build and deploy code and infrastructure for your organization.

To add your development environments and pipelines  and start scanning these environments, you need to generate access keys on Prisma Cloud.

[.task]
=== Generate Access Key

Prisma Cloud uses Access Keys to integrate the DevOps environments.

Access keys are specific to a user and they enforce the role and permissions assigned to the specified user.
+
NOTE: When you are prompted to add an API Token on any plugin, make sure to provide your Prisma Cloud access key ID and secret as the input.

[.procedure]
. Generate access keys for your DevOps environment.

.. Select *Settings > Access Keys > Add Access Key*.

//TODO:image::.png[width=800]

.. Enter Access key *Name*.
+
//TODO: image::.png[width=800]

.. Download and save your new Access Key ID and Secret Key in a secure location.
+
//TODO: image::.png[width=800]
+
NOTE: You will not be able to access this information later.

[.task]
=== Add Repositories and CI/CD Pipelines

To add  the environments that host your templates and source code, begin at *Settings > Repositories*.

The *Repositories* page is blank before you add any environments. The page continues to support the ability to add repositories and access the catalog of all different environments where you can scan for security and compliance violations using the Code Security plugins.

After you add one or more environments, you can view details of the repositories you have added, sort, search, or delete within the list.

[.procedure]
. Select *Settings > Repositories* to add new repositories or CI/CD pipelines.
+
//TODO: image::.png[width=400]

. Select *Add Repository* to add add new code repositories, CI/CD systems or IDEs for monitoring on Prisma Cloud and view Repositories Catalog.
